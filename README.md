# Family Rescue: 99 Nights (v3, no modal)

- Removed the Help modal completely (uses `alert()` instead) so nothing can block clicks.
- Filenames changed (`style-v3.css`, `main-v3.js`) to **bust browser cache** on GitHub Pages.
- Replace your repo files with these, then reload the page.

If you still see the old modal, force refresh with Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+R or open the page with `?v=3` at the end.
